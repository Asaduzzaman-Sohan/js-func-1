In javascript fuction is block of code designed to perform a particular task. kono barbar kora theke bachte fuction kore rakha hoi.. jokhn dorkar porbe setake call kore kaaj execute kora hobe.

fuction identifier(parameters){
    code;
}

parameter use for calculation and many other task

if I don't write anything after return so the fuction would not returnm anything.

We can write our expected task variables, calculation after return.
